## Contents

- **Fourier Domain (fourier_domain.nb):** contains the Fourier transforms. In this file, the conversion from the spatial domain to the frequency domain and the inverse mathematical operation are studied.
  
- **Functions of Bessel (functions_of_Bessel.nb):** studies the canonical solutions of Bessel differential equation. Bessel functions have applications in field yheory, acoustic theory, nuclear physics, radio physics, among others applications.
  
- **Optics (optics_SLI_system.nb):** determines the transfer and the impulse response function in a LSI system that it has been iluminated with coherent light.
  
- **On-axis digital holography (simulation_pyramid_code.nb):** simulates the holographic imaging technique with the phase variation method for a pure phase object. In particular, I have been created an object with triangular phase shifting.
  
- **On-axis digital holography (simulation_sphere_code.nb):** simulates the holographic imaging technique with the phase variation method for a pure phase object. In particular, I created an object with sphere phase shifting.
  
- **Electromagnetic field and electromagnetics wave (wave&fields.nb):** contains some the modes of vibration of electromagnetic waves in a cilyndrical waveguide. In particular, I studied and represented TE010 and TM010. In the TE mode, the electric field vector is entirely transverse to the direction of propagation. This means that there is no electric field component along the direction of wave travel. TE modes are often employed in waveguides where it is crucial to eliminate electrical interference. In TM mode, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation and an electric field is in the direction of propagation and electric field is in the direction of propagation.
  
- **Guides and electromagnetic waves (wave_envelope.nb):** studies the envelope of an oscillating signal is a smooth curve outlining its extremes.
